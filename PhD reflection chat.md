Almost end of second year, not producing trustworthy results

I think there might be something missing when I approach my research project. 
* imagine a table that I will show in each meeting; and there are something missing
* Verifying Fully-Finetuning couldn't solve CodeUpdateArena

Somewhat lack of ownership? Maybe I should've asked myself "Is this a result that could stand?", "If I show this table to someone else, would he be convinced? What are some missing evidence/experiment that could've strengthen my result?"

**Project:**
Do you think the project is heading in the right direction ?
Is the problem we are trying to solve beyond what community is capable of or we stumble upon a bad line of method (hypernet)?
