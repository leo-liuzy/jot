**Project:**
I am a little bit unsure where things would be heading. What would be a good sign failing criteria? Backup plan?

Do you think the project is heading in the right direction?

Is the problem we are trying to solve beyond what community is capable of or we stumble upon a bad line of method (hypernet)?


**Worry:**
Almost end of second year, not producing good results/paper
* Is there something wrong with the topic chosen? many negative results in KE/KP

Summarize what results O have gotten. 

I think there might be something missing when I approach my research project. 
* imagine a table that I will show in each meeting; and there are something missing
* Verifying Fully-Finetuning couldn't solve CodeUpdateArena

Somewhat lack of ownership? Maybe I should've asked myself "Is this a result that could stand?", "If I show this table to someone else, would he be convinced? What are some missing evidence/experiment that could've strengthen my result?"
